[pg_auto_dw](https://github.com/tembo-io/pg_auto_dw) is a new open source project, an auto-data warehouse extension that uses LLM to inspect operational Postgres schemas, and sets up automation to create a well-formed data warehouse. 

Whether it's Data Vault, Kimball format, etc I don't care - I just want something better than a dumb dev like me would build as a DW - a pile of ingested tables, and ad-hoc derivative tables. 

I have wanted this badly for years as a dev + data engineer. We aren't sure how this experiment will work out, but kind of fun to start something without certainty of success. 

We've recently partnered with our friend Johnathan Pickard from [Analyzer1](https://www.analyzer1.com/) to iterate with us on this project. Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), he will transition his previously built automations to be as fully-automated as possible.

## Why Postgres for Data Warehousing?

Postgres for everything — Postgres has been the de-facto operational store, now people are using it for analytics and data warehousing. We also have [a stack](https://tembo.io/docs/product/stacks/analytical/data-warehouse) which enables DWH from Postgres.

Efficient DWH schemas - One of the key things for DWH performance is the data structure and transformations going from operations to analytics. There are best practices such as Kimball or Data Vault that many software engineers aren't highly familiar with.

Doing transformations in Postgres - If Postgres is your operational store and your analytics store, why not rely on Postgres to do the transformations. With LLMs, we had the hunch that we could do this automatically.

## Why Postgres for Data Warehouse Automations?  

We do not believe that automating the creation of data warehousing structures should be offloaded and partitioned at the analytic edge.  Classically, operational data is offloaded at interval to be processed by a dedicated data team. 

This approach has several disadvantages. Firstly, it makes operational analytics an afterthought or at least an expensive and time consuming endeavor.  Secondly, it creates a very broad data sprawl which directly conflicts with the paradigm of a unified data model.  

PostgreSQL stands as the world's most popular, comprehensive, and extensible open-source database, with its growing trend reinforcing its future-proof status.

## How the extension works

If your source tables are well-structured and tables and fields are well-named, constructing a data warehouse can be achieved with a single call to the extension.

```SQL
SELECT auto_dw.go();
```

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Start(("Start")) --> ext["Install Extension"]
    ext -- #10711; --> build["auto_dw.go()"]
    build -- #10711; --> DW[("DW Created")]
    DW --> Done(("Done"))
    style Start stroke-width:1px,fill:#FFFFFF,stroke:#000000
    style ext color:none,fill:#FFFFFF,stroke:#000000
    style build fill:#e3fae3,stroke:#000000
    style DW fill:#FFFFFF,stroke:#000000
    style Done stroke-width:4px,fill:#FFFFFF,stroke:#000000
```

### Informative Functions

These functions do not affect the database:

* `health()` — Understand DW health
* `source_tables()` - Understand the status of all tables
* `source_columns()` — Understand the status of all table columns

### Interactive Functions

These functions affect the data warehouse portion of the database:

* `source_include(object_pattern)` — Add source objects
* `source_exclude(object_pattern)` — Remove source objects
* `update_context(object, context)` — Provide additional context to fine tune the automation
* `go(flag, status)` — Initiates the build and dataflows

## Join us on the Journey

We are just getting started. The development process is transparent and [open for everyone to see on GitHub](https://github.com/tembo-io/pg_auto_dw). 

We invite developers, data scientists, and technology enthusiasts to join us. Your insights and contributions are invaluable as we push the boundaries of what is possible.

Stay tuned for upcoming product demos and development blogs related to building and using this extension.
